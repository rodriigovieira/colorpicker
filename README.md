# Color Picking Game

This is a color picking game developed using Create-React-App. The concept is simple: you have to guess the correct color with the provided RGB color in the header. Once you've selected the correct color, all squares will display the correct color, and the game will end.

The application can be found live at: https://colorpicking.netlify.com/.

# Installation

It's a very simple app and the setup process is quick and simple.

First, just clone the repository. Run the following command:

`
git clone https://github.com/rodriigovieira/colorpicker.git
`

After, switch to the project's directory with cd and then install all dependencies:

`
cd colorpicker && yarn
`

To start the development server, you can run `yarn start`, whereas if you'd rather make a production build, just run `yarn build`.

# Features Coming Soon

Currently, the project has a tremendous number of bugs and lacks many features. These are the features that will soon be added:

- New Game button
- More levels (9, 6, 3 or 2 squares)
- Number of attempts before losing
- Translation to Brazilian Portuguese and possibility to switch languages
- Saving user config in the browser's LocalStorage (such as difficulty level, language and name)
